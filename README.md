# b-tree-miage

## General presentation

This project has the objective of adding functionalities on a base code that allows a binary tree to be generated via an algorithm and be visualized.

In this project openjdk@17.x will be used.

## To be added

- [ ] Modify current code in order to have the b-tree keys to be associated with pointers.
- [ ] Modify current code to be able to load a 10.000 line file into a a b-tree.
  - Each line will have to composed of an int and diverse information like a name ect ...
  - The file has te be able to indexed from an column. 
  - The column by which it will be indexed will be the key to the b-tree and the pointer associated with each key the line position.
